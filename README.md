# Basics-of-Python-related-to-conditional-statement-and-loop
Python's conditional statements (if-elif-else) enable decision-making based on conditions, while loops facilitate repeated execution of code until a condition is met. These basic constructs are essential for creating dynamic Python programs.

1. **Conditional Expressions:**
   - Program to identify whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.
   - Program to determine the larger of two numbers.
   - Program to check if a number is odd or even.
   - Program to classify an alphabet as a vowel or consonant.
   - Program to categorize a person's age into child, teenager, adult, or senior.
   - Simulation of a traffic light indicating whether to go, slow down, or stop.
   - Program to assign grades based on student scores.
   - Program to check if a year is a leap year.
   - Function to determine if a word or phrase is a palindrome.
   - Ticket price calculator based on the viewer's age.

2. **Loop:**
   - Printing numbers from 1 to 5 using a for loop.
   - Summing the squares of numbers from 1 to 5 using a for loop.
   - Printing the first 5 multiples of a given number using a for loop.
   - Generating multiplication tables using a for loop.
   - Checking if a number is prime using a for loop.
   - Finding the largest element in a list using a for loop.
   - Reversing a string using a for loop.
   - Calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 using a for loop.
   - Finding the factorial of a number using a for loop.
   - Printing numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.
   - Generating multiplication tables using a while loop.
   - Finding the factorial of a number using a while loop.
   - Calculating the sum of positive numbers entered by the user until a negative number is entered.
   - Implementing a guessing game using a while loop.

These examples cover the fundamental concepts of Python's conditional statements and loops, providing a solid foundation for beginners to start coding in Python.
